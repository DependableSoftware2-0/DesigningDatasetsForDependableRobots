## Abstract 
Learning-enabled components in robots must be assessed with respect to non-functional requirements (NFR)
such as reliability, fault tolerance and adapability in order to
ease the acceptance of robots into dynamic human-centered environments. While many factors impact NRFs, in this paper we
focus on datasets which are used to train learning models used in robots. In particular, we describe desirable characteristics for
robotics datasets, and identify the associated NRFs they affect. The characteristics are described in relation to the variability
of the instances in the dataset, out-of-distribution data, the spatio-temporal embodiment of robots and interaction failures.
